# 🧠 Customer Behaviour Analysis

A complete **Data Analytics Project** focused on understanding **customer behaviour** through data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer data to identify purchasing patterns, segment customers, and extract insights that help improve business decisions such as marketing strategies, product placement, and customer retention.

We used a combination of **Python** for data preprocessing and statistical analysis, **SQL** for querying and aggregating data, **Power BI** for interactive dashboards, and **Excel** for initial data exploration and validation.

## 🧩 Key Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Gathered customer transaction and demographic data from company database and CSV exports.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats using **Pandas**.
- Normalized categorical data and converted date columns.

### 3️⃣ Data Exploration (EDA)
- Identified top-selling products, high-value customers, and seasonal trends.
- Visualized distributions and correlations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis
- Created **aggregate queries** for customer segmentation.
- Used **JOINs**, **GROUP BY**, and **window functions** to extract key insights.

### 5️⃣ Visualization
- Built **Power BI dashboards** showing:
  - Sales trends over time  
  - Customer segmentation by age, region, and spending habits  
  - Product category performance  
  - Customer lifetime value (CLV)

### 6️⃣ Excel Reporting
- Created summary tables and pivot charts for non-technical stakeholders.

Would you like me to tailor this README for a **specific dataset or industry** (e.g., retail, e-commerce, banking)? I can adjust sections like “Insights” and “Data Structure” accordingly.
